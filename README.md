# qBitTorrent-API
Using Delphi to remotely control qBitTorrent

This is a Zoom Player download plug-in that can interact and remotely control qBitTorrent.

It is compatible with qBitTorrent API v2 (v4.2+ of qBitTorrent client) and is not compatible with older versions (although you can dig through the change history to find support for API v1).
